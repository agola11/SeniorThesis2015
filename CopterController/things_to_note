1) If you try to arm using DroneAPI without pressing the enable button, it makes the weird motor one at a time buzzing noise.

2) PREDICTION: You cannot arm without having an RC connection. This might be causing the fail to arm nonsense.

3) Check Mission Planner to see what pre-arm check it failed to do.

4) {command : 400, result : 3} -> DID NOT ARM, {command : 400, result : 0} -> DID ARM ???

5) You are able to arm the vehicle in STABILIZE mode, then change the mode to AUTO/LOITER.  You cannot arm while in AUTO/LOITER mode. However it seems that you can disarm in any mode.

6) If you leave the joystick down while in stablize mode, the vehicle will eventually disarm.

7) You somehow still have Yaw control while in auto mode????

8) Diff between guided mode and autonomous mode???

9) Best way to control two vehicles???

10) Best mode to fly in?  While sending commands in a loop can we still override after switching in STABILIZE mode ???

11) what mode to use channel override in???
